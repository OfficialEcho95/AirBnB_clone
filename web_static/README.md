## 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
This project is a follow up of the initial AirBnB_clone project, where we developed the command interpreter for managing the airBnb objects.
Although this time, I'd be working on the front end of that project, bringing the project alive.
This project is aimed at manipulating HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of the oage while CSS is the styling of the page, the design.
