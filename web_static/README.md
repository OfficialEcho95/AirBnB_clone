## AirBnB clone - Web static
AirBnB clone - Web static
This is a follow up project of the parent project the AirBnB_clone. In this project I'd be developing the front end of the initial project. For in the parent project we developed the command interpreter for managing the AirBnB objects.

This project is aimed at learning to manipulate HTML and CSS.
HTML is the structure of the page while CSS is the styling otherwise desgining of that structure.
